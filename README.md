# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
# Twitter Sentiment Analysis 📊🐦

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets based on specific keywords or hashtags. The analysis is performed using **Python** for data preprocessing and **Machine Learning** techniques for sentiment classification. It provides insights into the public perception of topics, brands, and events based on the sentiment of Twitter users' posts.

## 📜 Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of tweets and categorize them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. Using the **Tweepy** API, we collect real-time Twitter data, preprocess it for meaningful analysis, and apply a **Naive Bayes** classifier to categorize the sentiment. This analysis helps identify trends in public sentiment, sentiment distribution, and influential discussions on Twitter.

## 📊 Objectives
- Fetch real-time tweets using the Twitter API.
- Preprocess the tweet data by cleaning and tokenizing the text.
- Perform sentiment analysis on the tweets using a machine learning model.
- Visualize sentiment distribution and trends over time.
- Provide insights into the public perception of specific topics, brands, or hashtags.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: Tweepy, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib.
- **Environment**:  Google Colab
